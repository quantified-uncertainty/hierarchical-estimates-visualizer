## About

This repository displays hierarchical estimates. It presents the user with a tree with nodes which can be clicked on and inspected, which visualizes the underlying squiggle calculation.

So far, this mostly has visualization capabilities, meaning that edits are impermanent.

**If you want to use the utility function extractor for a project, we are happy to add a page for your project, like `hierarchical-visualization.quantifieduncertainty.org/your-project`**.
